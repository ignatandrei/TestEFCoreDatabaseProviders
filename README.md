# TestEFCoreDatabaseProviders

There are many Database Providers for EFCore

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli

I want to test the capabilities for each one within a standard choice of tables , in order to know the capabilities

I choose only those that have a version for current STS / LTS , whatever it is current.

( I am particularly interested in SqlServer vs Sqlite )
